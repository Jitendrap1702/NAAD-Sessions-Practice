# AlphaCols

You might have seen column names in MS Excel. It goes like A, B, C, …, Z, AA, AB, AC, …, AD, BA, BB, BC, …, BD, …, ZZZ, AAAA and so on. Here 1 is mapped to A, …, 27 is mapped to AA and so on.

1. Define a method String getColName(int col) which would return the respective column name. For example, getColName(100) should return “CV”. (Use IntelliJ)

2. Create a new App that would allow user to enter range i.e., starting no and ending no. On submitting these values, show a NumberPicker with column names from the corresponding name of starting no to the corresponding name of ending no. 

For example, the range (1, 702) should result in a NumberPicker with values ranging from “A” to “ZZ”

3. Add a checkbox with the label “Show column number”. When this checkbox is checked, your NumberPicker should show values like “1 - A”, “2 - B” etc.

4. Use your imagination to make this app more attractive

5. (Absolutely Optional) Try defining a method String getReverseColName(int col) which would return column names in reverse alphabets. For example, 1 mapped to Z, 2 mapped to Y, 3 mapped to Z etc. If you are able to do this, add a RadioButtonGroup to your app which would allow the user to choose between “Normal” and “Reverse” order.
